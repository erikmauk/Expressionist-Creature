# Expressionist-Creature (Computational Art: Lab 1)

In this lab, I created a rather somber looking penguin using JavaScript and 2D primative shapes. 
This lab also required my creation to fit the artistic style of expressionism.

My successs in fitting this style is, well, let's put it as up for interpretation.
However, I used dull colors and even put a tear on the penguin in order to convey a sense of sadness and loneliness.

Within this repository, you will find a screenshot of the final product attached. Enjoy!
